            <h1>PHASE 1: ORDER MATTERS</h1>
            <p>Phase 1 is all about how algorithms are all around us in our everyday lives. As children learn new school routines at the beginning of the year, Phase 1 will help them understand sequencing and make connections to computer science.</p>

        <h2>Powerful Ideas</h2>

            <h3>Learning Standards</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PK.AL.SR.7 Reflect and plan a logical series of steps to accomplish a task, such as writing a message, completing a puzzle, drawing a picture, or building a block structure.</li>
                <li>PK.08 Use directions such as up, down, in front, and behind.</li>
                <li>PK.PD.2 Demonstrate awareness of spatial boundaries and the ability to work and move within them.</li>
                <li>PK.SL.PKI.4 Describe familiar people, places, things, and events, and, with prompting and support, provide additional detail.</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>Children will understand that using steps (as in algorithms) helps us do tasks & solve problems in computer science, literature, and in daily life. Sometimes the order of steps when sequencing matters; other times, order does not matter.</p>

        <h3>Phase 1 Timeline</h3>
        <p>Each CRRAFT phase lasts approximately 6 weeks. Phases can and should overlap or be extended or shortened as needed in your classroom. This timeline is a suggestion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Cultural Relevance:</span> Celebrate differences! Discuss at-home routines (brushing teeth, making sandwiches; driving/walking to school). Routines can vary from family to family, be sure to celebrate these differences.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Order Matters:</span> Discuss why the order of steps is important in at-home routines. Consider times when the order may not matter as much. Recall algorithms for at-home tasks without actually doing them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Essential Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a sequence? What is important to know about sequences?</li>
            <li>How are coding sequences enacted (with robotics)?</li>
            <li>How do we use sequences to make sense of the world around us? How do we make sense of sequences?</li>
