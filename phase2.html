            <h2>Design Process Overview</h2>
            <p>The design process is a series of steps that help us solve complex problems in strategic and creative ways. It is essential to remember that this process is iterative; we can repeat steps as needed to refine our solutions. This approach encourages
                students to embrace mistakes as learning opportunities and to keep trying until they find the best solution.</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder">[Image of Design Process]</div>
            <p><strong>Steps in the Design Process:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the Problem: Understand the problem you need to solve.</li>
                <li>Brainstorm Solutions: Think of different ways to solve the problem.</li>
                <li>Plan: Develop a plan for your solution, considering materials and steps needed.</li>
                <li>Create a Prototype: Build a test model of your solution.</li>
                <li>Test and Evaluate: Test your prototype to see if it solves the problem. If not, go back and make improvements.</li>
                <li>Share: Present your solution to others, gather feedback, and make any necessary adjustments.</li>
