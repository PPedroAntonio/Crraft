            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Phase 3 of the CRRAFT Partnership is focused on helping students understand that they can accomplish big things by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This phase emphasizes the use of modularity, debugging, and algorithms
                to approach problem-solving in a structured way.</p>
            <p>The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of how to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller units and combining those units to achieve the larger goal. The curriculum is designed to be flexible, allowing phases to overlap,
                extend, or shorten based on classroom needs.</p>

        <section id="powerful-ideas">
            <h2>Powerful Ideas</h2>
            <p>Phase 3 emphasizes three powerful ideas that are central to the curriculum:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Breaking down complex tasks into simpler, more manageable units.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Identifying and solving problems by focusing on smaller steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Creating step-by-step procedures to solve tasks.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Curriculum Section -->
        <section id="curriculum">
            <h2>Curriculum Overview</h2>
            <p>The curriculum for Phase 3 is divided into several key activities, focal experiences, and small group tasks. These are designed to be hands-on and interactive, encouraging students to engage deeply with the material and concepts.</p>

            <h3>Phase 3 Timeline</h3>
            <p>Each CRRAFT phase lasts approximately 6 weeks, though the timeline is flexible to accommodate classroom needs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Introduce focal robot (Kibo), small group activities, and centers.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2-5:</strong> Continue building and exploring focal experiences, small groups, and centers.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> Combine learning and projects to culminate the phase.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Focal Experiences</h3>
            <p>Phase 3 includes several focal experiences designed to introduce and reinforce key concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>My Name is KIBO:</strong> Exploring hardware/software and modularity.</li>
                <li><strong>How Far Does Robot Go?</strong> Debugging and representation using robots.</li>
                <li><strong>Design/Build a City:</strong> Collaborating to design and build an interactive robot city.</li>
                <li><strong>Hokey Pokey:</strong> Using modularity and representation to program KIBO.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <p>The following materials are used in Phase 3 activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kibo Kit</li>
                <li>Code & Go Mouse</li>
                <li>Code-a-Pillar</li>
                <li>Other robots</li>

            <h3>Centers</h3>
            <p>Phase 3 centers provide a variety of hands-on learning opportunities, each focused on a different aspect of the curriculum:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Art Center:</strong> Creating plans for cities and designing KIBO stages.</li>
