            <h1>What to Expect</h1>
            <p>The CRR program is designed to help you engage children in computer science activities during class. There are 4 phases in the program that engage children with

                    <div class="label1" onclick="showModal('phase1')">7 powerful ideas of computer science.</div>
                </div>
                The phased approach gradually emphasizes these powerful ideas explicitly, but children are engaging with ALL powerful ideas in every phase. Each phase takes about 6 weeks and includes a focal experience to emphasize powerful ideas in computer science.
                You can do the focal experience any time during the phase, and you choose the lead up activities to get you and your students ready for the experience! We encourage you to use materials flexibly so that the program works for you and your
                students.

                        <p>The <strong>"Phase 1 Working Draft"</strong> of the CRRAFT Partnership School Curriculum, titled <em>"Order Matters"</em>, is an <strong>engaging educational resource</strong> designed to introduce young students to <strong>foundational concepts in computer science</strong>,
                            such as <em>sequencing, algorithms, and modularity</em>.</p>
                        <p>Through <strong>interactive activities</strong>, such as using <em>robot mice and coding cards</em>, children learn to see everyday routines as <strong>algorithms</strong>, understanding that the <strong>order of steps</strong>                            can sometimes be crucial. The curriculum emphasizes <strong>hands-on learning</strong> with a variety of materials, including <em>books, puzzles, and building blocks</em>, to help students grasp these important ideas.</p>
                        <p>This draft integrates <strong>cultural relevance</strong> and <strong>non-linear storytelling</strong>, making it an <strong>inclusive and comprehensive guide</strong> for educators aiming to foster early computational thinking
                            in their classrooms. It is an excellent tool for teachers to help students <strong>connect daily life experiences with computer science</strong>, fostering <strong>curiosity and problem-solving skills</strong> from an early
                            age.

                        <p>The <strong>"Phase 2 Working Draft"</strong> of the CRRAFT Partnership School Curriculum, titled <em>"We Can Do STEM"</em>, is an <strong>innovative educational resource</strong> designed to deepen students' understanding of <strong>STEM concepts</strong>                            through strategic problem-solving.</p>
                        <p>In Phase 2, students are introduced to the <strong>Design Process</strong>, a structured approach to tackling complex challenges by <em>planning, creating prototypes, and debugging</em>. This phase emphasizes the interaction between
                            <strong>hardware and software</strong>, helping students learn how robots work and how to communicate with them.</p>
                        <p>Through <strong>hands-on activities</strong> such as <em>building robots, coding, and designing solutions</em>, children are encouraged to see that STEM is accessible to everyone and can be applied to everyday problems. The curriculum
                            integrates <strong>cultural relevance</strong> and supports <strong>cyclical problem-solving</strong>, recognizing that issues can be revisited and refined over time.</p>
                        <p>This draft is an <strong>engaging and inclusive guide</strong> for educators, providing a wealth of resources, including <em>robot kits, art supplies, and interactive centers</em>, to help students develop their <strong>creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking skills</strong>.
                            Phase 2 is designed to inspire young learners to see themselves as capable problem-solvers who can use STEM to make a positive impact in their communities.</p>
